# Othello on STM32F3 Discovery
This project is an implementation of the Othello game on STM32F3 Discovery board. You can play against another person using UART or a keypad. Logic detects the winner and displays the status on a LCD. Logic also detects illegal moves and blinks on-board-LEDs. You can also enjoy nostalgic melodies playing on a buzzer while you play :).

NOTE THAT THE LOW CONTRAST IS DUE TO WEAK POWER SUPPLY, UNDER APPROPRIATE POWER SUPPLY LCD WORKS FLAWLESSLY.
